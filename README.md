# HyperShift


** This is a PERSONAL PROJECT to see if I can add vSphere to the supported listed of providers **
** This is not an official Red Hat thing, is not sanctioned by red hat and no support is expressed or implied **
** this may never come to fruition, or upsteam may beat me to it **

If the file called [FilesToAddress.md](FilesToAddress.md) exists, this is still a work in progress. All notes are in that file.


HyperShift is a middleware for hosting [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) control
planes at scale that solves for cost and time to provision, as well as portability
cross cloud with strong separation of concerns between management and workloads.
Clusters are fully compliant [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) (OCP)
clusters and are compatible with standard OCP and Kubernetes toolchains.
